<h1> Data analysis</h1>


<p>Note - the issue here is that the columns are not tagged and there is no easy way to interpret the data. This is a major issue with all data sets.And some coders do it later on however I believe that the best part is to create teh tagging now and create a proper data set now.<p>


STEP 2
<h3> ADD TAGGING and MERGE<h3>
<p> become add tag to tables to identify better<p>
<p> MERGE ALL TABLE <p>
